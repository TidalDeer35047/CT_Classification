# <b>CT-Scan Image Classification<b>

This repository comprises a black box implementation of an Image classifier built using Keras from tensorflow to discern the confidence level of whether the given CT-Scans are afflicted with Covid or not.

The datasets used are from [Here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/plameneduardo/sarscov2-ctscan-dataset) and [Here](https://github.com/UCSD-AI4H/COVID-CT).

A pre-trained model is provided under the repository for immediate use, and the epochs and batch-size can be adjusted for personal use, but suitable datasets can be provided for training and substituted at every instance of reference.

# <b>Installation<b>
